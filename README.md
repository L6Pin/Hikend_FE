<h1>Hikend ðŸŒ„</h1>


<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p> 
Inspired by my passion for hiking, with the creation of this web application I intended to conveniently allow anybody interested in spending time in nature to find a place that is near their point of interest. 
<br />
<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>For this project, the following technologies were used:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">HTML</span> - Used to create the markup of the page.</p>
    </li>
        <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">SASS/CSS</span> - Sass was used in order to streamline and simplify the styling of the page.</p>
    </li>
        </li>
        <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">ReactJS</span> - This framework was useful to more easily create sections and components of the website.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">React Router</span> - React Router was used to dynamically create single problem pages and conditional page redirection.</p>
    </li>
        <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Redux</span> - Redux was used for storing application critical data separate from the UI, that was used for profile verification and creating app functionalities using it.</p>
    </li>
        </li>
        <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Redux persist</span> - Redux persist is a library that allows certain state values to be saved to local storage, therefore making the data available even upon refreshing the page.</p>
    </li>
        </li>
        </li>
        <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Moment.js</span> - Moment.js is a library used for simple date and time formating.</p>
    </li>

</ul>
<h2>Application flow</h2>
Once the web page is opened, the user is greeted with a search bar where they enter the name of the city. Upon selecting, they will be redirected to a page where all the mountains related to that city are listed. The user has the ability to filter the displayed list, as well as sort it by alphabetical ascending (default) order or in a alphabetical descending order, as well as closest and furthest from the city, in real time.
<br />
<br />
Once a mountain is selected, the user will be redirected to the selected mountain page. There he will be able to find useful information such as:
  <ul>
    <li>Mountain peak</li>
    <li>Mountain height</li>
    <li>Description</li>
    <li>Local hiking clubs</li>
    <li>Map with a pin shwoing its location</li>
    <li>Available routes, their description and ability to download a .GPX file for offline navigation</li>
  </ul>
<br />
<br />
Both types of users can delete problems that are visible to them.
