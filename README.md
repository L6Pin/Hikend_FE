<h1>Hikend ðŸŒ„</h1>


<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p> 
Inspired by my passion for hiking, with the creation of this web application I intended to conveniently allow anybody interested in spending time in nature to find a place that is near their point of interest. 
<br />
<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>For this project, the following technologies were used:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Angular</span> - The framework chosen for this project due to its ability to create and easily work with a component based architecture.</p></li>

   <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Leaflet</span> - Open source JavaScript library used for displaying maps.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Application flow</h2>
Once the web page is opened, the user is greeted with a search bar where they enter the name of the city. Upon selecting, they will be redirected to a page where all the mountains related to that city are listed. The user has the ability to filter the displayed list, as well as sort it by alphabetical ascending (default) order or in a alphabetical descending order, as well as closest and furthest from the city, in real time.
<br />
<br />
Once a mountain is selected, the user will be redirected to the selected mountain page. There he will be able to find useful information such as:
  <ul>
    <li>Mountain peak</li>
    <li>Mountain height</li>
    <li>Description</li>
    <li>Local hiking clubs</li>
    <li>Map with a pin shwoing its location</li>
    <li>Available routes, their description and ability to download a .GPX file for offline navigation</li>
  </ul>
<br />
<br />
Both types of users can delete problems that are visible to them.
